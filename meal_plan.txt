To create a meal plan for Jack, we'll first estimate his daily caloric needs using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for men:

\[ \text{BMR} = 10 \times \text{weight in kg} + 6.25 \times \text{height in cm} - 5 \times \text{age in years} + 5 \]

Jack's weight in kilograms is approximately 88 kg (194 lbs / 2.205), and his height in centimeters is about 188 cm (74 inches x 2.54).

\[ \text{BMR} = 10 \times 88 + 6.25 \times 188 - 5 \times 19 + 5 \]
\[ \text{BMR} = 880 + 1175 - 95 + 5 \]
\[ \text{BMR} = 1965 \]

Since Jack has a moderate lifestyle, we'll multiply his BMR by an activity factor of 1.55 to estimate his total daily energy expenditure (TDEE):

\[ \text{TDEE} = 1965 \times 1.55 \approx 3046 \]
